# Application of Fractional-Order Gradient Descent and Integer-Order Gradient Descent : Comparison and Evaluation.


1. Project Introduction:

This project establishes a model of economic growth for USA countries from 1978 to 1997, in which the gross domestic product (GDP) is related to land area, arable land, population, school attendance, gross capital formation, exports of goods and services, general government, final
consumer spending and broad money. The fractional-order gradient descent and integer-order
gradient descent are used to estimate the model parameters to fit the GDP and forecast GDP from
1998 to 2000. The results show that the convergence rate of the fractional-order gradient descent is
faster and has a better fitting accuracy and prediction effect.

2. Usage:

With the functions we have built in file "function_model", you just need to input the data in file "america_dataset", run the program, and the results will be displayed on the screen. From the results obtained, we can generate statistics and create charts to evaluate the performance of the two algorithms.

3. System Requirements: Python
